The test file can be run and it will delete, create, and then load its own .db files named test.db and test2.db.

The mailroom_sql.py file needs a database file mailroom.db. This file can be created with the mailroom_sql.py file, but then needs to be
loaded with data. I included the file Load_Tables.py to load the mailroom.db with donor data.

Thanks for reviewing!
